# SE Design in the open
This is to try to use the GOVUK prototype kit for a website to illustrate how we design in the open. Just a personal trial for now.

**Work in progress**

## About the Prototype Kit

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

## Customisation

I have a [draft story on Medium]() explaining the changes I've done.

There is an [exisiting website](https://github.com/scotentSD) using Jekyll that my team is using. 

The code in this repository is [deployed on Heroku]().
